/**
 * image-localizer.js: a photo that arrived embedded becomes a file.
 *
 * The web app can't upload a file when it can't reach the server, so a photo
 * taken with no connection travels inside the row it belongs to, as a data
 * URL, and is turned back into an ordinary file here when the queue goes up
 * (src/lib/offline-api.js). Every route that accepts an image runs it
 * through this, so nothing is ever stored as a data URL: a row holds a path,
 * the way it always has.
 *
 * The same shape is used in NutriTrace and CookTrace.
